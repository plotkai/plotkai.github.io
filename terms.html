          <h2 id="the-basics">The Basics</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Use our services responsibly. Any illegal, unethical, or abusive use of Plotkai Interactive's platforms, software, or infrastructure will result in immediate suspension or termination.</li>
            <li>Don't overload, exploit, or misuse our systems. If we detect unusual or harmful activity, we may restrict or revoke access without notice to protect the integrity of our network and other users.</li>
            <li>We value your data security, but you are responsible for safeguarding your credentials, API keys, and project information shared through our services.</li>
            <li>You retain full ownership of your data and intellectual property. Upon written request, we will permanently delete your data and associated records from our systems within thirty (30) days, in accordance with privacy standards such as GDPR.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2 id="the-details">The Details</h2>
          <p>The following terms and conditions govern all use of the Plotkai Interactive website, software, applications, and related services (collectively referred to as the “Service”). The Service is operated by Plotkai Interactive (“Plotkai”, “we”, “us”, or “our”). Use of the Service is subject to your acceptance of these Terms, our Privacy Policy, and any other operational policies published by Plotkai Interactive. By accessing or using any part of our Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

          <p><em>Your Plotkai Account and Access.</em>
            If you create an account or collaborate with us through the Service, you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account information and for all activities under your account. Notify Plotkai immediately if you suspect unauthorized access or any security breach. We are not liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to maintain account security.</p>

          <p><em>Intellectual Property.</em>
            All intellectual property rights related to Plotkai Interactive, including but not limited to software, design systems, product frameworks, trademarks, logos, and documentation, remain the sole property of Plotkai Interactive or its licensors. You do not acquire any ownership rights by using our Service. Client-specific intellectual property developed under a service contract remains the client’s property as per the signed agreement.</p>

          <p><em>Technology and Security.</em>
            We take security seriously — our systems are built to safeguard your data with encryption, access control, and secure infrastructure. However, no system is invulnerable; by using our Service, you acknowledge that you understand and accept the inherent risks of transmitting data over the internet.</p>

          <p><em>Changes.</em>
            Plotkai Interactive reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to update, modify, or replace any part of these Terms at any time. You are responsible for checking this page periodically. Continued use of the Service after changes are published constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

          <p><em>Termination.</em>
            Plotkai Interactive may suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time, with or without cause or notice. You may terminate this Agreement by discontinuing use of the Service and requesting account deletion. Provisions that naturally survive termination — including ownership, confidentiality, warranty disclaimers, and limitation of liability — will remain in effect.</p>

          <p><em>Disclaimer of Warranties.</em>
            The Service is provided “as is” and “as available”. Plotkai Interactive and its partners disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We do not guarantee that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or immune to unauthorized access.</p>

          <p><em>Limitation of Liability.</em>
            In no event shall Plotkai Interactive, its affiliates, partners, or licensors be liable for (i) any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages; (ii) loss of profits, revenue, or data; (iii) cost of substitute services; or (iv) any damages exceeding the total fees paid by you to Plotkai Interactive in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim. This limitation applies regardless of the form of action and even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

          <p><em>General Representation and Warranty.</em>
            You agree that your use of the Service will comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and our policies. You also represent that your use will not infringe on or misappropriate any third-party intellectual property rights.</p>

          <p><em>Indemnification.</em>
            You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Plotkai Interactive, its employees, contractors, and affiliates from any claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from your use of the Service, your violation of these Terms, or your infringement of any intellectual property or privacy rights.</p>

          <p><em>Miscellaneous.</em>
            This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between you and Plotkai Interactive regarding the use of the Service. It may only be modified in writing signed by an authorized representative of Plotkai Interactive. These Terms shall be governed by the laws of India, without regard to its conflict of laws principles. Any disputes shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh, India. If any provision of this Agreement is found unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain valid and enforceable. A waiver of any term shall not be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach. You may not assign your rights under this Agreement without prior written consent. Plotkai Interactive may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement without restriction.</p>
