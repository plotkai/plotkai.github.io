            <p>At Plotkai Interactive, we take pride in building scalable and cost-efficient digital foundations for organizations doing meaningful work. One such collaboration was with Yognishtha Trust — a non-profit initiative focused on holistic wellbeing and community upliftment. Their goal was simple: to have a clean, fast, and sustainable website that communicated their mission effectively without recurring infrastructure costs.</p>
            
            <h2>Building for Simplicity and Impact</h2>
            
            <p>Instead of over-engineering the stack, we focused on efficiency. The site was designed with a minimal front-end, static content generation, and a fully automated CI/CD pipeline. Everything runs on Google Cloud's free-tier infrastructure — meaning Yognishtha Trust pays <strong>zero ongoing cost</strong> for hosting or maintenance.</p>
            
            <h2>A Seamless Deployment Pipeline</h2>
            
            <p>The deployment process was fully automated using GitHub Actions connected to Google Cloud Run. Every commit to the main branch triggers a build, runs validations, and deploys instantly. No manual intervention. No downtime. This ensures the team can make updates anytime with confidence — the infrastructure takes care of itself.</p>
            
            <ul>
              <li>Fully automated build and deploy workflow</li>
              <li>Hosted on Google Cloud Run free tier</li>
              <li>Optimized for speed and low compute footprint</li>
              <li>Single-iteration delivery — ready from concept to launch in one cycle</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2>Negligible Cost, Maximum Value</h2>
            
            <p>The project was designed intentionally to minimize cost for the client. By leveraging Google Cloud's always-free limits and an efficient deployment architecture, the ongoing cost remains <strong>negligible to none</strong>. Yognishtha Trust now has a sustainable digital presence that doesn't depend on paid infrastructure or manual upkeep.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
              <p>"Our goal was to create a digital home for Yognishtha Trust that is as peaceful and enduring as the values it represents — lightweight, reliable, and cost-free."</p>

            </div>
            
            <p>This pipeline ensures zero-touch deployment. The website is automatically rebuilt and redeployed whenever content or code changes — delivering a smooth experience both for the maintainers and the end users.</p>
            
            <h2>One Iteration, One Vision</h2>
            
            <p>The project required only a single iteration to reach production — a testament to clear communication, focused design, and automation-driven engineering. For Yognishtha Trust, this meant instant launch with long-term reliability, all at no recurring cost.</p>
            
            <p>At Plotkai Interactive, we believe every digital product — even a simple website — should be sustainable, fast, and effortless to maintain. The Yognishtha Trust project is a small but powerful example of how smart engineering choices can make technology affordable for everyone.</p>
