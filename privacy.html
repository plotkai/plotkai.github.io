          <p>Thank you for choosing to be part of our community at <strong>Plotkai Interactive</strong> ("Plotkai", "Company", "we", "us", or "our"). We’re committed to respecting your privacy and protecting your personal information. If you have any questions or concerns about this policy or our data practices, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@plotkai.com">support@plotkai.com</a>.</p>
          
          <p>When you visit our websites or use our products and services, you trust us with your information — and we take that responsibility seriously. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and the rights you have in relation to it. Please read it carefully. If you do not agree with any part of this policy, please discontinue using our Sites or services.</p>
          
          <p>This Privacy Policy applies to all information collected through our websites, products, and any related services, sales, marketing, or events (collectively referred to as the “Sites”).</p>

          <h2 id="the-basics">The Basics</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><em>You own your data.</em> That's a first principle of our company.</li>
            <li>We only ask for personal information when we truly need it to provide a service.</li>
            <li>We don't share your personal information except to comply with the law, improve our products, or protect our rights.</li>
            <li>We don't store personal data unless required for the ongoing operation of our services.</li>
            <li>We make it simple for you to control what's visible, kept private, or permanently deleted.</li>
            <li>Your project data and assets are considered confidential and belong solely to you or your organization.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
          <p><em>Non-Personal Information.</em> Like most websites, Plotkai collects non-personally identifying information such as browser type, language preference, referring site, and timestamps of visitor requests. We use this to understand how visitors use our site and to improve user experience.</p>
          
          <p><em>Personal Information.</em> Certain visitors choose to interact with Plotkai in ways that require us to gather personally-identifying information — such as your name, email address, or billing details. We only collect this information when necessary to provide a product, service, or communication you’ve requested.</p>
          
          <p>Visitors can always choose not to provide personally-identifying information, with the understanding that it may prevent access to certain features or services.</p>

          <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
          <p>We use collected data to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Provide, operate, and maintain our services</li>
            <li>Improve, personalize, and expand our offerings</li>
            <li>Communicate with you — including for support, updates, and marketing (if opted in)</li>
            <li>Process payments and fulfill transactions</li>
            <li>Ensure compliance with legal obligations</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Protection of Information</h2>
          <p>We disclose personal information only to employees, contractors, and service providers who need to know it in order to process it on our behalf — and who have agreed to keep it confidential. Some of these may be located outside your home country; by using our services, you consent to such transfers.</p>

          <p>We take appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data against unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction.</p>

          <h2>Cookies</h2>
          <p>We use cookies and similar technologies to improve your browsing experience, understand usage patterns, and personalize content. You can choose to refuse cookies in your browser settings, though some features of the site may not function properly without them.</p>

          <h2>Your Rights</h2>
          <p>You have the right to access, correct, delete, or restrict the processing of your personal information. To exercise these rights, contact us at <a href="mailto:support@plotkai.com">support@plotkai.com</a>.</p>

          <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
          <p>We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated “Last Modified” date. Continued use of our services after changes means you accept the updated policy.</p>
